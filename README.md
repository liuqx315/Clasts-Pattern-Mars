# Clasts-Pattern-Mars
The codes are to reproduce the figures and data analysis within our manuscript titled "Hyperuniformity on Mars: Pebbles scattered on sand" by Zheng Zhu, Bernard Hallet, Andras Sipos, Gabor Domokos, Quan-Xing Liu*, submitted to 2024. arXiv [Preprint] (2023). https://doi.org/10.48550/arXiv.2312.13818

The codes are classified by their function on model simulation, statistical analysis, and spatial hyperuniformity. 


# Code:

The fold within "sk and df" were modified from our previous pulished paper,

    sk and df # this fold icnludes all the statistical analysis on hyperuniform states.

The fold "Model simulation"  implement the clast reptation on sand ripples.

It is sorted by the figures in the article, so there may be duplicates in different folders.
The data and code list reads as follows: codes, FIG_xx_yy, MSL image raw data, and Gobi image raw data, where xx and yy represent the figure number and data source, respectively. 

`density_fluctuation.m` :Two-dimensional density_fluctuation of a set of points.

`struct_factor_sq.m` :Two-dimensional static structure factor of a set of points.

`clastsrun.m` : individual-based model of the clasts movements on aeolian sands written in MATLAB 2019a.

`spectral2D.m` :Two-dimensional spectral analysis of an image file, from http://www.nioo.knaw.nl/homepages/koppel

`main.m` :Computation of obeserved data and possion point process in Fig.2.

`rippleformation.m` :sand dune model of Werner 1995.

`sinuosity.m` :Mean sinuosity of the sand ripples from a binary image.

`plot*.m` :Plot of the figure in each folder.

`powerspectrum2d.m` :Two-dimensional powerspectrum of an image file.

`DJI_*.JPG`  :Photos taken by DJI drones at the Gobi desert.

# Dataset

`MSL image Raw data` :Mars images in Gale Crater downloaded from https://mars.nasa.gov/msl/home/.

`*.csv` and `*.mat`:files that save the results of the analyses in each folder for further ploting used in main figures and SI figures.

`Gobi image Raw data` :Images of Gobi clasts were collected from Alxa Left Banner. 

`Movies ripple migration` :Images and movies show the spatial scale and migration speed of ripples  alongside Gobi clasts in Alxa Left Banner.
