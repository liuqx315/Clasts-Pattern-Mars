The codes are to reproduce the figures and data analysis within our manuscript titled "Dispersed pebbles on Mars: An unexpected setting for hyperuniformity" by Zheng Zhu, Bernard Hallet, Andras Sipos, Gabor Domokos, Quan-Xing Liu*, submitted to Science Advances 2023.

The codes are classified by their function on model simulation, statistical analysis, and spatial hyperuniformity. 

The fold within sk and df modified from our previou pulished paper, 

  'Circular swimming motility and disordered hyperuniform state in an algae system by Huang et al, 118 (18) e2100493118'
